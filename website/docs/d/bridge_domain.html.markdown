# aci_bridge_domain #
Data source for ACI Bridge Domain

## Example Usage ##

```hcl
data "aci_bridge_domain" "dev_bd" {
  tenant_dn  = "${aci_tenant.dev_tenant.id}"
  name       = "foo_bd"
}
```
## Argument Reference ##
* `tenant_dn` - (Required) Distinguished name of parent Tenant object.
* `name` - (Required) name of Object bridge_domain.



## Attribute Reference

* `id` - Attribute id set to the Dn of the Bridge Domain.
* `optimize_wan_bandwidth` - (Optional) Flag to enable OptimizeWanBandwidth between sites.
* `annotation` - (Optional) annotation for object bridge_domain.
* `arp_flood` - (Optional) A property to specify whether ARP flooding is enabled. If flooding is disabled, unicast routing will be performed on the target IP address.
* `ep_clear` - (Optional) Represents the parameter used by the node (i.e. Leaf) to clear all EPs in all leaves for this BD.
* `ep_move_detect_mode` - (Optional) The End Point move detection option uses the Gratuitous Address Resolution Protocol (GARP). A gratuitous ARP is an ARP broadcast-type of packet that is used to verify that no other device on the network has the same IP address as the sending device.
* `host_based_routing` - (Optional) Enables advertising host routes out of l3outs of this BD.
* `intersite_bum_traffic_allow` - (Optional) Control whether BUM traffic is allowed between sites.
* `intersite_l2_stretch` - (Optional) Flag to enable l2Stretch between sites.
* `ip_learning` - (Optional) Endpoint Dataplane Learning.
* `ipv6_mcast_allow` - (Optional) Flag to indicate multicast IpV6 is allowed or not.
* `limit_ip_learn_to_subnets` - (Optional) Limits IP address learning to the bridge domain subnets only. Every BD can have multiple subnets associated with it. By default, all IPs are learned.
* `ll_addr` - (Optional) override of system generated ipv6 link-local address.
* `mac` - (Optional) The MAC address of the bridge domain (BD) or switched virtual interface (SVI). Every BD by default takes the fabric-wide default MAC address. You can override that address with a different one. By default the BD will take a 00:22:BD:F8:19:FF mac address.
* `mcast_allow` - (Optional) Flag to indicate if multicast is enabled for IpV4 addresses.
* `multi_dst_pkt_act` - (Optional) The multiple destination forwarding method for L2 Multicast, Broadcast, and Link Layer traffic types.
* `name_alias` - (Optional) name_alias for object bridge_domain.
* `bridge_domain_type` - (Optional) The specific type of the object or component.
* `unicast_route` - (Optional) The forwarding method based on predefined forwarding criteria (IP or MAC address). 
* `unk_mac_ucast_act` - (Optional) The forwarding method for unknown layer 2 destinations.
* `unk_mcast_act` - (Optional) The parameter used by the node (i.e. a leaf) for forwarding data for an unknown multicast destination.
* `v6unk_mcast_act` - (Optional) v6unk_mcast_act for object bridge_domain.
* `vmac` - (Optional) Virtual MAC address of the BD/SVI. This is used when the BD is extended to multiple sites using l2 Outside.
