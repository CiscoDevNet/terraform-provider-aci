## Attribute Reference

The only attribute that this resource exports is the `id`, which is set to the
Dn of the Subnet.

## Importing

An existing Subnet can be [imported][docs-import] into this resource via its Dn, via the following command:
[docs-import]: https://www.terraform.io/docs/import/index.html

```
terraform import aci_subnet.example "<Dn>"
```
