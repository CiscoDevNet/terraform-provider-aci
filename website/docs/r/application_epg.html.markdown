## Attribute Reference

The only attribute that this resource exports is the `id`, which is set to the
Dn of the Application EPG.

## Importing

An existing Application EPG can be [imported][docs-import] into this resource via its Dn, via the following command:
[docs-import]: https://www.terraform.io/docs/import/index.html

```
terraform import aci_application_epg.example "<Dn>"
```
Starting in Terraform version 1.5, an existing EPG can be imported using [import blocks](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) via the following configuration:

 ```hcl
 import {
    id = "<Dn>"
    to = aci_aci_application_epg.example
 }
 ```
