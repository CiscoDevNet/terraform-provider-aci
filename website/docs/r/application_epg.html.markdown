# aci_application_epg

Manages ACI Application EPG

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "aci_application_epg" "fooapplication_epg" {
    application_profile_dn  = aci_application_profile.app_profile_for_epg.id
    name  					        = "demo_epg"
    description 			      = "from terraform"
    annotation  			      = "tag_epg"
    exception_tag 		    	= "0"
    flood_on_encap  	      = "disabled"
    fwd_ctrl  			      	= "none"
    has_mcast_source     		= "no"
    is_attr_based_epg     	= "no"
    match_t  				        = "AtleastOne"
    name_alias  		      	= "alias_epg"
    pc_enf_pref  		      	= "unenforced"
    pref_gr_memb  	    		= "exclude"
    prio  				        	= "unspecified"
    shutdown  		      		= "no"
    relation_fv_rs_bd       = aci_bridge_domain.example.id
}

## Attribute Reference

The only attribute that this resource exports is the `id`, which is set to the
Dn of the Application EPG.

## Importing

An existing Application EPG can be [imported][docs-import] into this resource via its Dn, via the following command:
[docs-import]: https://www.terraform.io/docs/import/index.html

```
terraform import aci_application_epg.example <Dn>
```
