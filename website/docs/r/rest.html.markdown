  }
}

resource "aci_rest" "madebyrest_yaml" {

- `class_name` - (Optional) Which class object is being created. (Make sure there is no colon in the classname )
- `content` - (Optional) Map of key-value pairs those needed to be passed to the Model object as parameters. Make sure the key name matches the name with the object parameter in ACI.
