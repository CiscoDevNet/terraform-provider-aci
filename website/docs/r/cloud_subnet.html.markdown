# aci_cloud_subnet #
Manages ACI Cloud Subnet
<b>Note: This resource is supported in Cloud APIC only.</b>

## API Information ##

* `Class` - cloudSubnet
* `Distinguished Name` - uni/tn-{tenant_name}/ctxprofile-{cloud_context_profile_name}/cidr-[{addr}]/subnet-[{ip}]

## GUI Information ##

* `Location` - Application Management -> Cloud Context Profile -> CIDR Block Range Subnets -> Subnet -> Subnet Group Label

## Example Usage ##

```hcl
resource "aci_cloud_subnet" "foocloud_subnet" {
  cloud_cidr_pool_dn = aci_cloud_cidr_pool.example.id
  description        = "sample cloud subnet"
  name               = "subnet1"
  ip                 = "14.12.0.0/28"
  annotation         = "tag_subnet"
  name_alias         = "alias_subnet"
  scope              = sort(["shared", "public"]) # Use the sorted scope list to handle identical changes
  usage              = "user"
  zone               = data.aci_cloud_availability_zone.aws_region_availability_zone.id # Only applicable to the AWS vendor
  subnet_group_label = "subnet_group_label" # Only applicable to the GCP vendor
}
```


## Argument Reference ##
* `cloud_cidr_pool_dn` - (Required) Distinguished name of the Cloud CIDR Pool parent object.
* `ip` - (Required) CIDR block of the Cloud Subnet object.
* `name` - (Optional) Name of the Cloud Subnet object.
* `description` - (Optional) Description of the Cloud Subnet object.
* `annotation` - (Optional) Annotation of the Cloud Subnet object.
* `name_alias` - (Optional) Name alias of the Cloud Subnet object.
* `scope` - (Optional) List of domain applicable to the capability. Allowed values are "public", "private" and "shared". Default is ["private"]. Use the sorted scope list to handle identical changes.
* `usage` - (Optional) The usage of the port. This property shows how the port is used. Allowed values are "user", "gateway" and "infra-router". Default is "user". To make any subnet a Gateway subnet use `usage` = "gateway".	
* `zone` - (Optional) [AWS Only] Availability zone where the subnet must be deployed. This property can carry both the actual zone or the ACI logical zone name. In the former case, the driver directly uses the value of this property. In the latter case, the Connector has to first resolve the mapping from ACI logical zone to the actual AWS zone. This parameter is required in APIC v5.0 or higher
* `relation_cloud_rs_subnet_to_flow_log` - (Optional) Relation to class cloudAwsFlowLogPol. Cardinality - N_TO_ONE. Type - String.
* `subnet_group_label` - (Optional) Subnet Group Label of the Cloud Subnet object. It is only applicable to the GCP vendor.


## Attribute Reference

The only attribute that this resource exports is the `id`, which is set to the
Dn of the Cloud Subnet.

## Importing ##

An existing Cloud Subnet can be [imported][docs-import] into this resource via its Dn, via the following command:
[docs-import]: https://www.terraform.io/docs/import/index.html


```
terraform import aci_cloud_subnet.example <Dn>
```
