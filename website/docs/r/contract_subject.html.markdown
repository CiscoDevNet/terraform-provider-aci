Manages ACI Contract Subject

## Example Usage

```hcl
	resource "aci_contract_subject" "foocontract_subject" {
		contract_dn   = aci_contract.example.id
		description   = "from terraform"
		name          = "demo_subject"
		annotation    = "tag_subject"
		cons_match_t  = "AtleastOne"
		name_alias    = "alias_subject"
		prio          = "level1"
		prov_match_t  = "AtleastOne"
		rev_flt_ports = "yes"
		target_dscp   = "CS0"
	}

	resource "aci_contract_subject" "foocontract_subject_2" {

## Attribute Reference

The only attribute that this resource exports is the `id`, which is set to the
Dn of the Contract Subject.

## Importing

An existing Contract Subject can be [imported][docs-import] into this resource via its Dn, via the following command:
[docs-import]: https://www.terraform.io/docs/import/index.html

```
terraform import aci_contract_subject.example <Dn>
