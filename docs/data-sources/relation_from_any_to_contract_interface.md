## Schema ##

### Required ###

* `parent_dn` - (string) The distinguished name (DN) of the parent object, possible resources:
  - [aci_any](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/CiscoDevNet/aci/latest/docs/resources/any) ([vzAny](https://pubhub.devnetcloud.com/media/model-doc-latest/docs/app/index.html#/objects/vzAny/overview))
* `imported_contract_name` (tnVzCPIfName) - (string) The name of the imported Contract object. This attribute can be referenced from a [resource](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/CiscoDevNet/aci/latest/docs/resources/imported_contract) with `aci_imported_contract.example.name` or from a [datasource](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/CiscoDevNet/aci/latest/docs/data-sources/imported_contract) with `data.aci_imported_contract.example.name`.

You can configure the bandwidth of each QoS level using QoS profiles.
