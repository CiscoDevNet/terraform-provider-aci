## Schema ##

### Required ###

* `parent_dn` - (string) The distinguished name (DN) of the parent object, possible resources:
  - [aci_application_profile](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/CiscoDevNet/aci/latest/docs/resources/application_profile) ([fvAp](https://pubhub.devnetcloud.com/media/model-doc-latest/docs/app/index.html#/objects/fvAp/overview))
* `name` (name) - (string) The name of the Endpoint Security Group object.

### Read-Only ###

* `id` - (string) The distinguished name (DN) of the Endpoint Security Group object.

* `name_alias` (nameAlias) - (string) The name alias of the Endpoint Security Group object.
* `intra_esg_isolation` (pcEnfPref) - (string) Parameter used to determine whether communication between endpoints within the ESG is blocked.
* `preferred_group_member` (prefGrMemb) - (string) Parameter used to determine whether the ESG is part of the preferred group. Members of this group are allowed to communicate without contracts.
* `admin_state` (shutdown) - (string) Withdraw the ESG configuration from all nodes in the fabric.

* `relation_to_consumed_contracts` - (list) A list of Relation To Consumed Contracts (ACI object [fvRsCons](https://pubhub.devnetcloud.com/media/model-doc-latest/docs/app/index.html#/objects/fvRsCons/overview)) pointing to Contract (ACI Object [vzBrCP](https://pubhub.devnetcloud.com/media/model-doc-latest/docs/app/index.html#/objects/vzBrCP/overview)).
