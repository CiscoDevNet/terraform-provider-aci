```

## Schema ##

### Required ###

* `name` (name) - (string) The name of the Link Level Interface Policy object.

### Read-Only ###

* `id` - (string) The distinguished name (DN) of the Link Level Interface Policy object.
* `annotation` (annotation) - (string) The annotation of the Link Level Interface Policy object. This attribute is supported in ACI versions: 3.2(1l) and later.
* `auto_negotiation` (autoNeg) - (string) The auto-negotiation mode of the Link Level Interface Policy object. Auto-negotiation is an optional function of the IEEE 802.3u Fast Ethernet standard that enables devices to automatically exchange information over a link about speed and duplex abilities.
* `description` (descr) - (string) The description of the Link Level Interface Policy object.
* `port_delay` (dfeDelayMs) - (string) The port delay (milliseconds) applied when the interface is coming up for the the Link Level Interface Policy object. The value must be in the range 0 - 10000. This attribute is supported in ACI versions: 4.2(5k) and later.
* `emi_retrain` (emiRetrain) - (string) The Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) retrain state the Link Level Interface Policy object. This attribute is supported in ACI versions: 4.2(7q) to 4.2(7w), 5.2(4d) and later.
* `fec_mode` (fecMode) - (string) The Forwarding Error Correction (FEC) mode of the Link Level Interface Policy object. This attribute is supported in ACI versions: 1.3(1g) and later.
* `link_debounce` (linkDebounce) - (string) The link debounce interval (milliseconds) of the Link Level Interface Policy object. Setting a value greater than 0 enables the debounce timer on physical interface ports. A value of 0 disables the debounce timer. The value must be in the range 0 - 5000.
* `name_alias` (nameAlias) - (string) The name alias of the Link Level Interface Policy object. This attribute is supported in ACI versions: 2.2(1k) and later.
* `owner_key` (ownerKey) - (string) The key for enabling clients to own their data for entity correlation.
* `owner_tag` (ownerTag) - (string) A tag for enabling clients to add their own data. For example, to indicate who created this object.
* `physical_media_type` (portPhyMediaType) - (string) The physical media type of the Link Level Interface Policy object. This attribute is supported in ACI versions: 5.1(3e) and later.
* `speed` (speed) - (string) The speed of the Link Level Interface Policy object. The data transfer rate for the port should match the destination to which the port is linked.
* `annotations` - (list) A list of Annotations (ACI object [tagAnnotation](https://pubhub.devnetcloud.com/media/model-doc-latest/docs/app/index.html#/objects/tagAnnotation/overview)). This attribute is supported in ACI versions: 3.2(1l) and later.
    * `key` (key) - (string) The key used to uniquely identify this configuration object.
    * `value` (value) - (string) The value of the property.
* `tags` - (list) A list of Tags (ACI object [tagTag](https://pubhub.devnetcloud.com/media/model-doc-latest/docs/app/index.html#/objects/tagTag/overview)). This attribute is supported in ACI versions: 3.2(1l) and later.
    * `key` (key) - (string) The key used to uniquely identify this configuration object.
    * `value` (value) - (string) The value of the property.
