data "aci_mcp_interface_policy" "example" {
  name = "test_name"
}

```

## Schema ##

### Required ###

* `name` (name) - (string) The name of the MCP Interface Policy object.

### Read-Only ###

* `id` - (string) The distinguished name (DN) of the MCP Interface Policy object.
* `admin_state` (adminSt) - (string) The administrative state of the MCP Interface Policy object.
* `annotation` (annotation) - (string) The annotation of the MCP Interface Policy object. This attribute is supported in ACI versions: 3.2(1l) and later.
* `description` (descr) - (string) The description of the MCP Interface Policy object.
* `grace_period_seconds` (gracePeriod) - (string) The grace period in seconds for the MCP Interface Policy object. This attribute is only applicable when 'strict_mode' is 'on'. The value must be in the range 0 - 300. This attribute is supported in ACI versions: 5.2(4d) and later.
* `grace_period_milliseconds` (gracePeriodMsec) - (string) The grace period in milliseconds for the MCP Interface Policy object. This attribute is only applicable when 'strict_mode' is 'on'. The value must be in the range 0 - 999. This attribute is supported in ACI versions: 5.2(4d) and later.
* `maximum_number_of_vlan` (maxPduPerVlanLimit) - (string) The maximum amount of VLANs for the MCP Interface Policy object. The value must be in the range 1 - 2000 when 'strict_mode' is 'off', else the value must be in range 1 - 256. This attribute is supported in ACI versions: 6.0(2h) and later.
* `strict_mode` (mcpMode) - (string) Enable strict mode for the MCP Interface Policy object. This attribute is supported in ACI versions: 5.2(4d) and later.
* `mcp_pdu_per_vlan` (mcpPduPerVlan) - (string) Send MCP PDU packets per VLAN for the MCP Interface Policy object. This attribute is supported in ACI versions: 6.0(2h) and later.
* `name_alias` (nameAlias) - (string) The name alias of the MCP Interface Policy object. This attribute is supported in ACI versions: 2.2(1k) and later.
* `owner_key` (ownerKey) - (string) The key for enabling clients to own their data for entity correlation.
* `owner_tag` (ownerTag) - (string) A tag for enabling clients to add their own data. For example, to indicate who created this object.
* `initial_delay_time` (strictInitDelayTime) - (string) The initial delay time in seconds for the MCP Interface Policy object. This allows for MCP to wait before sending Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDUs) which gives Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) on the external network time to converge. This attribute is only applicable when 'strict_mode' is 'on'. The value must be in the range 0 - 1800. This attribute is supported in ACI versions: 5.2(4d) and later.
* `transmission_frequency_seconds` (strictTxFreq) - (string) The transmission frequency in seconds for the MCP Interface Policy object. This attribute is only applicable when 'strict_mode' is 'on'. The value must be in the range 0 - 300. This attribute is supported in ACI versions: 5.2(4d) and later.
* `transmission_frequency_milliseconds` (strictTxFreqMsec) - (string) The transmission frequency in milliseconds for the MCP Interface Policy object. This attribute is only applicable when 'strict_mode' is 'on'. The value must be in the range 0 - 999. This attribute is supported in ACI versions: 5.2(4d) and later.
* `annotations` - (list) A list of Annotations (ACI object [tagAnnotation](https://pubhub.devnetcloud.com/media/model-doc-latest/docs/app/index.html#/objects/tagAnnotation/overview)). This attribute is supported in ACI versions: 3.2(1l) and later.
    * `key` (key) - (string) The key used to uniquely identify this configuration object.
    * `value` (value) - (string) The value of the property.
* `tags` - (list) A list of Tags (ACI object [tagTag](https://pubhub.devnetcloud.com/media/model-doc-latest/docs/app/index.html#/objects/tagTag/overview)). This attribute is supported in ACI versions: 3.2(1l) and later.
    * `key` (key) - (string) The key used to uniquely identify this configuration object.
