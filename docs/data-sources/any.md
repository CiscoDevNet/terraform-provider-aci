  - [aci_vrf](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/CiscoDevNet/aci/latest/docs/resources/vrf) ([fvCtx](https://pubhub.devnetcloud.com/media/model-doc-latest/docs/app/index.html#/objects/fvCtx/overview))

### Read-Only ###

* `id` - (string) The distinguished name (DN) of the Any object.
* `annotation` (annotation) - (string) The annotation of the Any object. This attribute is supported in ACI versions: 3.2(1l) and later.
* `description` (descr) - (string) The description of the Any object.
* `match_criteria` (matchT) - (string) The provider label match criteria.
* `name` (name) - (string) The name of the Any object.
* `name_alias` (nameAlias) - (string) The name alias of the Any object. This attribute is supported in ACI versions: 2.2(1k) and later.
* `preferred_group_member` (prefGrMemb) - (string) Parameter used to determine whether the EPG is part of the preferred group. Members of this group are allowed to communicate without contracts. This attribute is supported in ACI versions: 2.1(1h) and later.

    * `value` (value) - (string) The value of the property.
* `tags` - (list) A list of Tags (ACI object [tagTag](https://pubhub.devnetcloud.com/media/model-doc-latest/docs/app/index.html#/objects/tagTag/overview)). This attribute is supported in ACI versions: 3.2(1l) and later.
    * `key` (key) - (string) The key used to uniquely identify this configuration object.
    * `value` (value) - (string) The value of the property.
* `relation_from_any_to_consumer_contracts` - (list) A list of Relation From Any To Consumer Contracts (ACI object [vzRsAnyToCons](https://pubhub.devnetcloud.com/media/model-doc-latest/docs/app/index.html#/objects/vzRsAnyToCons/overview)) pointing to Contract (ACI Object [vzBrCP](https://pubhub.devnetcloud.com/media/model-doc-latest/docs/app/index.html#/objects/vzBrCP/overview)).
