  target_dn = "uni/vmmp-VMware/dom-domain_2"
}

```

## Schema ##

### Required ###

* `parent_dn` - (string) The distinguished name (DN) of the parent object, possible resources:
  - [aci_application_epg](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/CiscoDevNet/aci/latest/docs/resources/application_epg) ([fvAEPg](https://pubhub.devnetcloud.com/media/model-doc-latest/docs/app/index.html#/objects/fvAEPg/overview))
* `target_dn` (tDn) - (string) The distinguished name of the target Domain object.

### Read-Only ###

* `id` - (string) The distinguished name (DN) of the Relation To Domain object.
* `annotation` (annotation) - (string) The annotation of the Relation To Domain object.
* `binding_type` (bindingType) - (string) The binding type of the Relation To Domain object.
* `class_preference` (classPref) - (string) The class preference of the Relation To Domain object. Set 'useg' to allow microsegmentation.
* `custom_epg_name` (customEpgName) - (string) The display name of the user configured port-group.
* `delimiter` (delimiter) - (string) The delimiter of the Relation To Domain object.
* `encapsulation` (encap) - (string) The encapsulation of the Relation To Domain object. The encapsulation refers to the EPG VLAN when class preference is set to 'encap, or to the Secondary VLAN when class preference is set to 'useg'.
* `encapsulation_mode` (encapMode) - (string) The encapsulation mode of the Relation To Domain object.
* `epg_cos` (epgCos) - (string) The class of service (CoS) of the Relation To Domain object.
* `epg_cos_pref` (epgCosPref) - (string) The class of service (CoS) preference of the Relation To Domain object.
* `deployment_immediacy` (instrImedcy) - (string) The deployment immediacy of the Relation To Domain object. Specifies when the policy is pushed into the hardware policy content-addressable memory (CAM).
* `ipam_dhcp_override` (ipamDhcpOverride) - (string) The IP address management (IPAM) DHCP override of the Relation To Domain object. Only applicable for Nutanix domains.
* `ipam_enabled` (ipamEnabled) - (string) The IP address management (IPAM) enabled status of the Relation To Domain object. Only applicable for Nutanix domains.
* `ipam_gateway` (ipamGateway) - (string) The IP address management (IPAM) gateway of the Relation To Domain object. Only applicable for Nutanix domains.
* `lag_policy_name` (lagPolicyName) - (string) The link aggregation group (LAG) policy name of the Relation To Domain object.
* `netflow_direction` (netflowDir) - (string) The NetFlow monitoring direction of the Relation To Domain object.
* `enable_netflow` (netflowPref) - (string) The Netflow enabled status for the Relation To Domain object.
* `number_of_ports` (numPorts) - (string) The number of ports of the Relation To Domain object.
* `port_allocation` (portAllocation) - (string) Port allocation for ports.
* `primary_encapsulation` (primaryEncap) - (string) The primary encapsulation of the Relation To Domain object. This is used when the class preference is set to 'useg'.
* `primary_encapsulation_inner` (primaryEncapInner) - (string) The primary inner encapsulation of the Relation To Domain object. This is used for the portgroup at the VMWare Distributed Virtual Switch (DVS). This VLAN is internal to the DVS and is used for communication between the other VMs and the AVE VM at a host. Traffic is not forwarded to the fabric over the VLAN. Only applicable for Cisco ACI Virtual Edge (AVE) domains.
* `resolution_immediacy` (resImedcy) - (string) The resolution immediacy of the Relation To Domain object. Specifies if policies are resolved immmediately or when needed.
* `secondary_encapsulation_inner` (secondaryEncapInner) - (string) The secondary inner encapsulation of the Relation To Domain object. This is used for the portgroup at the VMWare Distributed Virtual Switch (DVS). This VLAN is internal to the DVS and is used for communication between the other VMs and the AVE VM at a host. Traffic is not forwarded to the fabric over the VLAN. Only applicable for Cisco ACI Virtual Edge (AVE) domains.
* `switching_mode` (switchingMode) - (string) The switching mode of the Relation To Domain object.
* `untagged` (untagged) - (string) The untagged status of the Relation To Domain object.
* `annotations` - (list) A list of Annotations (ACI object [tagAnnotation](https://pubhub.devnetcloud.com/media/model-doc-latest/docs/app/index.html#/objects/tagAnnotation/overview)). This attribute is supported in ACI versions: 3.2(1l) and later.
