# aci_relation_to_fibre_channel_path #

Manages ACI Relation To Fibre Channel Path



## API Information ##

* Class: [fvRsFcPathAtt](https://pubhub.devnetcloud.com/media/model-doc-latest/docs/app/index.html#/objects/fvRsFcPathAtt/overview)

* Supported in ACI versions: 2.0(1m) and later.

* Distinguished Name Format: `uni/tn-{name}/ap-{name}/epg-{name}/rsfcPathAtt-[{tDn}]`

## GUI Information ##

* Location: `Tenants -> Application Profiles -> Application EPGs -> Fibre Channel (Paths)`

## Example Usage ##

The configuration snippet below creates a Relation To Fibre Channel Path with only required attributes.

```hcl

resource "aci_relation_to_fibre_channel_path" "example_application_epg" {
  parent_dn = aci_application_epg.example.id
  target_dn = "topology/pod-1/paths-101/pathep-[eth1/1]"
}

```
The configuration snippet below shows all possible attributes of the Relation To Fibre Channel Path.

!> This example might not be valid configuration and is only used to show all possible attributes.

```hcl

resource "aci_relation_to_fibre_channel_path" "full_example_application_epg" {
  parent_dn   = aci_application_epg.example.id
  annotation  = "annotation"
  description = "description_1"
  target_dn   = "topology/pod-1/paths-101/pathep-[eth1/1]"
  vsan        = "vsan-10"
  vsan_mode   = "native"
  annotations = [
    {
      key   = "key_0"
      value = "value_1"
    }
  ]
  tags = [
    {
      key   = "key_0"
      value = "value_1"
    }
  ]
}

```

## Schema ##

### Required ###

* `parent_dn` - (string) The distinguished name (DN) of the parent object, possible resources:
  - [aci_application_epg](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/CiscoDevNet/aci/latest/docs/resources/application_epg) ([fvAEPg](https://pubhub.devnetcloud.com/media/model-doc-latest/docs/app/index.html#/objects/fvAEPg/overview))
* `target_dn` (tDn) - (string) The distinguished name of the target.

### Read-Only ###

* `id` - (string) The distinguished name (DN) of the Relation To Fibre Channel Path object.

## Importing

An existing Relation To Fibre Channel Path can be [imported](https://www.terraform.io/docs/import/index.html) into this resource with its distinguished name (DN), via the following command:

```
terraform import aci_relation_to_fibre_channel_path.example_application_epg uni/tn-{name}/ap-{name}/epg-{name}/rsfcPathAtt-[{tDn}]
```

Starting in Terraform version 1.5, an existing Relation To Fibre Channel Path can be imported
using [import blocks](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) via the following configuration:

```
import {
  id = "uni/tn-{name}/ap-{name}/epg-{name}/rsfcPathAtt-[{tDn}]"
  to = aci_relation_to_fibre_channel_path.example_application_epg
}
```
