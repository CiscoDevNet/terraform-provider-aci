# aci_relation_to_static_leaf #

Manages ACI Relation To Static Leaf



## API Information ##

* Class: [fvRsNodeAtt](https://pubhub.devnetcloud.com/media/model-doc-latest/docs/app/index.html#/objects/fvRsNodeAtt/overview)

* Supported in ACI versions: 1.0(1e) and later.

* Distinguished Name Format: `uni/tn-{name}/ap-{name}/epg-{name}/rsnodeAtt-[{tDn}]`

## GUI Information ##

* Location: `Tenants -> Application Profiles -> Application EPGs -> Static Leafs`

## Example Usage ##

The configuration snippet below creates a Relation To Static Leaf with only required attributes.

```hcl

resource "aci_relation_to_static_leaf" "example_application_epg" {
  parent_dn     = aci_application_epg.example.id
  encapsulation = "vlan-101"
  target_dn     = "topology/pod-1/node-101"
}

```
The configuration snippet below shows all possible attributes of the Relation To Static Leaf.

!> This example might not be valid configuration and is only used to show all possible attributes.

```hcl

resource "aci_relation_to_static_leaf" "full_example_application_epg" {
  parent_dn            = aci_application_epg.example.id
  annotation           = "annotation"
  description          = "description_1"
  encapsulation        = "vlan-101"
  deployment_immediacy = "immediate"
  mode                 = "native"
  target_dn            = "topology/pod-1/node-101"
  annotations = [
    {
      key   = "key_0"
      value = "value_1"
    }
  ]
  tags = [
    {
      key   = "key_0"
      value = "value_1"
    }
  ]
}

```

All examples for the Relation To Static Leaf resource can be found in the [examples](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/terraform-provider-aci/tree/master/examples/resources/aci_relation_to_static_leaf) folder.

## Schema ##

### Required ###

* `parent_dn` - (string) The distinguished name (DN) of the parent object, possible resources:
  - [aci_application_epg](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/CiscoDevNet/aci/latest/docs/resources/application_epg) ([fvAEPg](https://pubhub.devnetcloud.com/media/model-doc-latest/docs/app/index.html#/objects/fvAEPg/overview))
* `encapsulation` (encap) - (string) The VLAN encapsulation of the Relation To Static Leaf object.
* `target_dn` (tDn) - (string) The distinguished name of the target of this static binding.

### Read-Only ###

* `id` - (string) The distinguished name (DN) of the Relation To Static Leaf object.

### Optional ###
  
* `annotation` (annotation) - (string) The annotation of the Relation To Static Leaf object.
  - Default: `orchestrator:terraform`
* `description` (descr) - (string) The description of the Relation To Static Leaf object.
* `deployment_immediacy` (instrImedcy) - (string) The deployment immediacy of the Relation To Static Leaf object. Specifies when the policy is pushed into the hardware policy content-addressable memory (CAM).
  - Default: `lazy`
  - Valid Values: `immediate`, `lazy`.
* `mode` (mode) - (string) The static association mode with the path of the Relation To Static Leaf object.

## Importing

An existing Relation To Static Leaf can be [imported](https://www.terraform.io/docs/import/index.html) into this resource with its distinguished name (DN), via the following command:

```
terraform import aci_relation_to_static_leaf.example_application_epg uni/tn-{name}/ap-{name}/epg-{name}/rsnodeAtt-[{tDn}]
```

Starting in Terraform version 1.5, an existing Relation To Static Leaf can be imported
using [import blocks](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) via the following configuration:

```
import {
  id = "uni/tn-{name}/ap-{name}/epg-{name}/rsnodeAtt-[{tDn}]"
  to = aci_relation_to_static_leaf.example_application_epg
}
```
