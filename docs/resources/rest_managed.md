# aci_rest_managed (Resource)

Manages ACI Model Objects via REST API calls. This resource can only manage a single API object and its direct children. It is able to read the state and therefore reconcile configuration drift.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "aci_rest_managed" "example_tenant" {
  dn         = "uni/tn-EXAMPLE_TENANT"
  class_name = "fvTenant"
  content = {
    name  = "EXAMPLE_TENANT"
    descr = "Example description"
  }
}

resource "aci_rest_managed" "example_managent_connectivity" {
  dn         = "uni/fabric/connectivityPrefs"
  class_name = "mgmtConnectivityPrefs"
  annotation = "orchestrator:example"
  content = {
    interfacePref = "ooband"
  }
}

resource "aci_rest_managed" "example_tenant_2" {
  dn         = "uni/tn-EXAMPLE_TENANT2"
  class_name = "fvTenant"
  content = {
    name = "EXAMPLE_TENANT2"
    annotation = "orchestrator:class"
  }
  child {
    rn         = "ctx-VRF1"
    class_name = "fvCtx"
    content = {
      name = "VRF1"
      annotation = "orchestrator:child"
    }
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- **class_name** (String) Which class object is being created. (Make sure there is no colon in the classname)
- **dn** (String) Distinguished name of object being managed including its relative name, e.g. uni/tn-EXAMPLE_TENANT.

### Optional

- **annotation** (String) Annotation for the class object that is being created. When annotation is provided in content this will take precedence. Defaults to "orchestrator:terraform" when not provided.
- **child** (Block Set) List of children. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--child))
- **content** (Map of String) Map of key-value pairs those needed to be passed to the Model object as parameters. Make sure the key name matches the name with the object parameter in ACI.

### Read-Only

- **id** (String) The distinguished name of the object.

<a id="nestedblock--child"></a>
### Nested Schema for `child`

Required:

- **rn** (String) The relative name of the child object.

Optional:

- **class_name** (String) Class name of child object.
- **content** (Map of String) Map of key-value pairs which represents the attributes for the child object.

## Import

Note: Import is not supported for child configuration objects.

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
terraform import aci_rest_managed.example_tenant uni/tn-EXAMPLE_TENANT
```
