Manages ACI Bridge Domain


  !> This resource has been migrated to the terraform plugin protocol version 6, refer to the [migration guide](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/CiscoDevNet/aci/latest/docs/guides/migration) for more details and implications for already managed resources.

## API Information ##

* Class: [fvBD](https://pubhub.devnetcloud.com/media/model-doc-latest/docs/app/index.html#/objects/fvBD/overview)

* Supported in ACI versions: 1.0(1e) and later.

* Distinguished Name Format: `uni/tn-{name}/BD-{name}`

## GUI Information ##

* Location: `Tenants -> Networking -> Bridge Domains`

## Example Usage ##

The configuration snippet below creates a Bridge Domain with only required attributes.

```hcl

resource "aci_bridge_domain" "example_tenant" {
  parent_dn = aci_tenant.example.id
  name      = "test_name"
}

```
The configuration snippet below shows all possible attributes of the Bridge Domain.

!> This example might not be valid configuration and is only used to show all possible attributes.

An existing Bridge Domain can be [imported](https://www.terraform.io/docs/import/index.html) into this resource with its distinguished name (DN), via the following command:

```
terraform import aci_bridge_domain.example_tenant uni/tn-{name}/BD-{name}
```

Starting in Terraform version 1.5, an existing Bridge Domain can be imported
using [import blocks](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) via the following configuration:

```
import {
  id = "uni/tn-{name}/BD-{name}"
  to = aci_bridge_domain.example_tenant
}
```
