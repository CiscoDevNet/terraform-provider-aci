# aci_application_epg #

Manages ACI Application EPG



## API Information ##

* Class: [fvAEPg](https://pubhub.devnetcloud.com/media/model-doc-latest/docs/app/index.html#/objects/fvAEPg/overview)

* Supported in ACI versions: 1.0(1e) and later.

* Distinguished Name Format: `uni/tn-{name}/ap-{name}/epg-{name}`

## GUI Information ##

* Location: `Tenants -> Application Profiles -> Application EPGs`

## Example Usage ##

The configuration snippet below creates a Application EPG with only required attributes.

```hcl

resource "aci_application_epg" "example_application_profile" {
  parent_dn = aci_application_profile.example.id
  name      = "test_name"
}

```
The configuration snippet below shows all possible attributes of the Application EPG.
