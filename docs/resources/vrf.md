# aci_vrf

Manages ACI VRF

## API Information ##

* `Class` - fvCtx
* `Distinguished Name` - uni/tn-{name}/ctx-{name}

## GUI Information ##

* `Location` - Tenant -> Networking -> VRFs

## Example Usage ##

```hcl
resource "aci_vrf" "foovrf" {
  tenant_dn              = aci_tenant.tenant_for_vrf.id
  name                   = "demo_vrf"
  description            = "from terraform"
  annotation             = "tag_vrf"
  bd_enforced_enable     = "no"
  ip_data_plane_learning = "enabled"
  knw_mcast_act          = "permit"
  name_alias             = "alias_vrf"
  pc_enf_dir             = "egress"
  pc_enf_pref            = "unenforced"
  relation_fv_rs_ctx_to_bgp_ctx_af_pol {
    af                     = "ipv4-ucast"
    tn_bgp_ctx_af_pol_name = aci_bgp_address_family_context.example.id
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

- `tenant_dn` - (Required) Distinguished name of parent Tenant object.
- `name` - (Required) Name of Object VRF.
- `annotation` - (Optional) Annotation tags for object VRF.
- `description` - (Optional) Description tags for object VRF.
- `bd_enforced_enable` - (Optional) Flag to enable/disable enforced bridge domain for VRF. Allowed values are "yes" and "no". Default is "no".
- `ip_data_plane_learning` - (Optional) Flag to enable/disable IP-data-plane learning for VRF. Allowed values are "enabled" and "disabled". Default is "enabled".
- `knw_mcast_act` - (Optional) Specifies if known multicast traffic is forwarded or not. Allowed values are "permit" and "deny". Default is "permit".
- `name_alias` - (Optional) Name alias for object VRF.
- `pc_enf_dir` - (Optional) Policy Control Enforcement Direction. It is used for defining policy enforcement direction for the traffic coming to or from an L3Out. Egress and Ingress directions are wrt L3Out. Default will be Ingress. But on the existing L3Outs during upgrade it will get set to Egress so that right after upgrade behavior doesn't change for them. This also means that there is no special upgrade sequence needed for upgrading to the release introducing this feature. After upgrade user would have to change the property value to Ingress. Once changed, system will reprogram the rules and prefix entry. Rules will get removed from the egress leaf and will get installed on the ingress leaf. Actrl prefix entry, if not already, will get installed on the ingress leaf. This feature will be ignored for the following cases: 1. Golf: Gets applied at Ingress by design. 2. Transit Rules get applied at Ingress by design. 4. vzAny 5. Taboo. Allowed values are "egress" and "ingress". Default is "ingress".
- `pc_enf_pref` - (Optional) Determines if the fabric should enforce contract policies to allow routing and packet forwarding. Allowed values are "enforced" and "unenforced". Default is "enforced".

- `relation_fv_rs_ospf_ctx_pol` - (Optional) Relation to class ospfCtxPol. Cardinality - N_TO_ONE. Type - String.
- `relation_fv_rs_vrf_validation_pol` - (Optional) Relation to class l3extVrfValidationPol. Cardinality - N_TO_ONE. Type - String.
- `relation_fv_rs_ctx_mcast_to` - (Optional) Relation to class vzFilter. Cardinality - N_TO_M. Type - [Set of String].
- `relation_fv_rs_ctx_to_eigrp_ctx_af_pol` - (Optional) Relation to class eigrpCtxAfPol. Cardinality - N_TO_M. Type - [Set of Map].
- `relation_fv_rs_ctx_to_ospf_ctx_pol` - (Optional) Relation to class ospfCtxPol. Cardinality - N_TO_M. Type - [Set of Map].
- `relation_fv_rs_ctx_to_ep_ret` - (Optional) Relation to class fvEpRetPol. Cardinality - N_TO_ONE. Type - String.
- `relation_fv_rs_bgp_ctx_pol` - (Optional) Relation to class bgpCtxPol. Cardinality - N_TO_ONE. Type - String.
- `relation_fv_rs_ctx_mon_pol` - (Optional) Relation to class monEPGPol. Cardinality - N_TO_ONE. Type - String.
- `relation_fv_rs_ctx_to_ext_route_tag_pol` - (Optional) Relation to class l3extRouteTagPol. Cardinality - N_TO_ONE. Type - String.
- `relation_fv_rs_ctx_to_bgp_ctx_af_pol` - (Optional) A block representing the relationship to class bgpCtxAfPol. Cardinality - N_TO_M. Type - Block.
  * `af` - (Required) The BGP address family. Allowed values are "ipv4-ucast", "ipv6-ucast", and default value is "ipv4-ucast". Type: String.
  * `tn_bgp_ctx_af_pol_name` - (Required) Distinguished name (DN) of the BGP address family context policy object. Type: String.


Note: In the APIC GUI,a VRF (fvCtx) was called a "Context"or "PrivateNetwork."

## Attribute Reference ##

The only attribute that this resource exports is the `id`, which is set to the
Dn of the VRF.

## Importing

An existing VRF can be [imported][docs-import] into this resource via its Dn, via the following command:
[docs-import]: <https://www.terraform.io/docs/import/index.html>

```bash
terraform import aci_vrf.example <Dn>
```
