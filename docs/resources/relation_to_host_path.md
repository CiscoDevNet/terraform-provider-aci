Manages ACI Relation To Host Path



## API Information ##

* Class: [infraRsHPathAtt](https://pubhub.devnetcloud.com/media/model-doc-latest/docs/app/index.html#/objects/infraRsHPathAtt/overview)

* Supported in ACI versions: 1.1(1j) and later.

* Distinguished Name Format: `uni/infra/hpaths-{name}/rsHPathAtt-[{tDn}]`

## GUI Information ##

* Location: `Generic`

## Example Usage ##

The configuration snippet below creates a Relation To Host Path with only required attributes.

```hcl

resource "aci_relation_to_host_path" "example_host_path_selector" {
  parent_dn = aci_host_path_selector.example.id
  target_dn = "topology/pod-1/paths-101/pathep-[eth1/1]"
}

```
The configuration snippet below shows all possible attributes of the Relation To Host Path.

!> This example might not be valid configuration and is only used to show all possible attributes.

```hcl

resource "aci_relation_to_host_path" "full_example_host_path_selector" {
  parent_dn  = aci_host_path_selector.example.id
  annotation = "annotation"
  target_dn  = "topology/pod-1/paths-101/pathep-[eth1/1]"
  annotations = [
    {
      key   = "key_0"
      value = "value_1"
    }
  ]
  tags = [
    {
      key   = "key_0"
      value = "value_1"
    }
  ]
}

```

## Importing

An existing Relation To Host Path can be [imported](https://www.terraform.io/docs/import/index.html) into this resource with its distinguished name (DN), via the following command:

```
terraform import aci_relation_to_host_path.example_host_path_selector uni/infra/hpaths-{name}/rsHPathAtt-[{tDn}]
```

Starting in Terraform version 1.5, an existing Relation To Host Path can be imported
using [import blocks](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) via the following configuration:

```
import {
  id = "uni/infra/hpaths-{name}/rsHPathAtt-[{tDn}]"
  to = aci_relation_to_host_path.example_host_path_selector
}
```
