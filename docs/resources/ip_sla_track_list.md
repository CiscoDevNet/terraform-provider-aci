# aci_ip_sla_track_list #

Manages ACI IP SLA Track List



## API Information ##

* Class: [fvTrackList](https://pubhub.devnetcloud.com/media/model-doc-latest/docs/app/index.html#/objects/fvTrackList/overview)

* Supported in ACI versions: 4.1(1i) and later.

* Distinguished Name Format: `uni/tn-{name}/tracklist-{name}`

## GUI Information ##

* Location: `Tenants -> Policies -> Protocol -> IP SLA -> Track Lists`

## Example Usage ##

The configuration snippet below creates a IP SLA Track List with only required attributes.

```hcl

resource "aci_ip_sla_track_list" "example_tenant" {
  parent_dn = aci_tenant.example.id
  name      = "test_name"
}

```
The configuration snippet below shows all possible attributes of the IP SLA Track List.

!> This example might not be valid configuration and is only used to show all possible attributes.

```hcl

resource "aci_ip_sla_track_list" "full_example_tenant" {
  parent_dn       = aci_tenant.example.id
  annotation      = "annotation"
  description     = "description_1"
  name            = "test_name"
  name_alias      = "name_alias_1"
  owner_key       = "owner_key_1"
  owner_tag       = "owner_tag_1"
  percentage_down = "30"
  percentage_up   = "40"
  type            = "weight"
  weight_down     = "10"
  weight_up       = "20"
  relation_to_ip_sla_track_members = [
    {
      annotation = "annotation_1"
      target_dn  = aci_ip_sla_track_member.example.id
      weight     = "20"
      annotations = [
        {
          key   = "key_0"
          value = "value_1"
        }
      ]
      tags = [
        {
          key   = "key_0"
          value = "value_1"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
  annotations = [
    {
      key   = "key_0"
      value = "value_1"
    }
  ]
  tags = [
    {
      key   = "key_0"
      value = "value_1"
    }
  ]
}

```

## Importing

An existing IP SLA Track List can be [imported](https://www.terraform.io/docs/import/index.html) into this resource with its distinguished name (DN), via the following command:

```
terraform import aci_ip_sla_track_list.example_tenant uni/tn-{name}/tracklist-{name}
```

Starting in Terraform version 1.5, an existing IP SLA Track List can be imported
using [import blocks](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) via the following configuration:

```
import {
  id = "uni/tn-{name}/tracklist-{name}"
  to = aci_ip_sla_track_list.example_tenant
}
```
