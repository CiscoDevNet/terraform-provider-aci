Manages ACI VMM Credential


  !> This resource has been migrated to the terraform plugin protocol version 6, refer to the [migration guide](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/CiscoDevNet/aci/latest/docs/guides/migration) for more details and implications for already managed resources.

## API Information ##

* Class: [vmmUsrAccP](https://pubhub.devnetcloud.com/media/model-doc-latest/docs/app/index.html#/objects/vmmUsrAccP/overview)

* Supported in ACI versions: 1.0(1e) and later.

* Distinguished Name Format: `uni/vmmp-{vendor}/dom-{name}/usracc-{name}`

## GUI Information ##

* Location: `Virtual Networking -> Provider -> Domain -> Credentials`

## Example Usage ##

The configuration snippet below creates a VMM Credential with only required attributes.

```hcl

resource "aci_vmm_credential" "example_vmm_domain" {
  parent_dn = aci_vmm_domain.example.id
  name      = "test_name"
}

```
The configuration snippet below shows all possible attributes of the VMM Credential.

!> This example might not be valid configuration and is only used to show all possible attributes.

```hcl

resource "aci_vmm_credential" "full_example_vmm_domain" {
  parent_dn   = aci_vmm_domain.example.id
  annotation  = "annotation"
  description = "description_1"
  name        = "test_name"
  name_alias  = "name_alias_1"
  owner_key   = "owner_key_1"
  owner_tag   = "owner_tag_1"
  password    = "password_1"
  username    = "username_1"
  annotations = [
    {
      key   = "key_0"
      value = "value_1"
    }
  ]
  tags = [
    {
      key   = "key_0"
      value = "value_1"
    }
  ]
}

```

## Importing

An existing VMM Credential can be [imported](https://www.terraform.io/docs/import/index.html) into this resource with its distinguished name (DN), via the following command:

```
terraform import aci_vmm_credential.example_vmm_domain uni/vmmp-{vendor}/dom-{name}/usracc-{name}
```

Starting in Terraform version 1.5, an existing VMM Credential can be imported
using [import blocks](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) via the following configuration:

```
import {
  id = "uni/vmmp-{vendor}/dom-{name}/usracc-{name}"
  to = aci_vmm_credential.example_vmm_domain
}
```
