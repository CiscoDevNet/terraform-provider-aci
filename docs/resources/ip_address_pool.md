# aci_ip_address_pool #

Manages ACI IP Address Pool



## API Information ##

* Class: [fvnsAddrInst](https://pubhub.devnetcloud.com/media/model-doc-latest/docs/app/index.html#/objects/fvnsAddrInst/overview)

* Supported in ACI versions: 1.0(1e) and later.

* Distinguished Name Format: `uni/tn-{name}/addrinst-{name}`

## GUI Information ##

* Location: `Tenants (mgmt) -> IP Address Pools`

## Example Usage ##

The configuration snippet below creates a IP Address Pool with only required attributes.

```hcl

resource "aci_ip_address_pool" "example" {
  gateway_address = "10.0.0.1/24"
  name            = "test_name"
}

```
The configuration snippet below shows all possible attributes of the IP Address Pool.

!> This example might not be valid configuration and is only used to show all possible attributes.

```hcl

resource "aci_ip_address_pool" "full_example" {
  gateway_address         = "10.0.0.1/24"
  address_type            = "regular"
  annotation              = "annotation"
  description             = "description_1"
  name                    = "test_name"
  name_alias              = "name_alias_1"
  owner_key               = "owner_key_1"
  owner_tag               = "owner_tag_1"
  skip_gateway_validation = "no"
  ip_address_blocks = [
    {
      annotation  = "annotation_1"
      description = "description_1"
      from        = "10.0.0.2"
      name        = "name_1"
      name_alias  = "name_alias_1"
      to          = "10.0.0.5"
      annotations = [
        {
          key   = "key_0"
          value = "value_1"
        }
      ]
      tags = [
        {
          key   = "key_0"
          value = "value_1"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
  annotations = [
    {
      key   = "key_0"
      value = "value_1"
    }
  ]
  tags = [
    {
      key   = "key_0"

## Importing

An existing IP Address Pool can be [imported](https://www.terraform.io/docs/import/index.html) into this resource with its distinguished name (DN), via the following command:

```
terraform import aci_ip_address_pool.example uni/tn-{name}/addrinst-{name}
```

Starting in Terraform version 1.5, an existing IP Address Pool can be imported
using [import blocks](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) via the following configuration:

```
import {
  id = "uni/tn-{name}/addrinst-{name}"
  to = aci_ip_address_pool.example
}
```
