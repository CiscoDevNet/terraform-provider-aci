resource "aci_host_path_selector" "example" {
  name = "host_path_selector"
}

```
The configuration snippet below shows all possible attributes of the Host Path Selector.

!> This example might not be valid configuration and is only used to show all possible attributes.

```hcl

resource "aci_host_path_selector" "full_example" {
  annotation  = "annotation"
  description = "description"
  name        = "host_path_selector"
  name_alias  = "name_alias"
  owner_key   = "owner_key"
  owner_tag   = "owner_tag"
  annotations = [
    {
      key   = "key_0"
      value = "value_1"
    }
  ]
  tags = [
    {
      key   = "key_0"
      value = "value_1"
    }
  ]
}

## Importing

An existing Host Path Selector can be [imported](https://www.terraform.io/docs/import/index.html) into this resource with its distinguished name (DN), via the following command:

```
terraform import aci_host_path_selector.example uni/infra/hpaths-{name}
```

Starting in Terraform version 1.5, an existing Host Path Selector can be imported
using [import blocks](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) via the following configuration:

```
import {
  id = "uni/infra/hpaths-{name}"
  to = aci_host_path_selector.example
}
```
