documentation:
    endTime: The end time of the %s object. The default value cannot be used directly, since APIC will calculate this value to the datetime representation which results in a applied state that does not match the planned state. Do not provide this attribute when APIC should calculate the current datetime ('now'). Furthermore, make sure that the time-zone part (in the full example this is '-08:00') matches the time-zone configured on APIC. Providing a different time-zone will result in unexpected behaviour.
    keyName: The key name of the %s object.
    preSharedKey: The  pre-shared key of the %s object.
    startTime: The start time of the %s object. Please make sure that the time-zone part (in the full example this is '-08:00') matches the time-zone configured on APIC. Providing a different time-zone will result in unexpected behaviour.
