documentation:
    autoNeg: The auto-negotiation mode of the %s object. Auto-negotiation is an optional function of the IEEE 802.3u Fast Ethernet standard that enables devices to automatically exchange information over a link about speed and duplex abilities.
    dfeDelayMs: The port delay (milliseconds) applied when the interface is coming up for the the %s object. The value must be in the range 0 - 10000.
    emiRetrain: The Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) retrain state the %s object.
    fecMode: The Forwarding Error Correction (FEC) mode of the %s object.
    linkDebounce: The link debounce interval (milliseconds) of the %s object. Setting a value greater than 0 enables the debounce timer on physical interface ports. A value of 0 disables the debounce timer. The value must be in the range 0 - 5000.
    portPhyMediaType: The physical media type of the %s object.
    speed: The speed of the %s object. The data transfer rate for the port should match the destination to which the port is linked.
