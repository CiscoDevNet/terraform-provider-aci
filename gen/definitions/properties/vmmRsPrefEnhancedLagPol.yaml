# TODO: Include this target for vmmDomP when working on vswitch policy migration
# Excluded from tests because current testing capabilities are not allowing to configure in single apply
# The relationship needs to point to an object that is configured as a child of vswitch policy, which is a child of vmmDomP
# Current resources have the limitation that the vmm_domain needs to be created, then the vswitch_policy and then the relationship can be applied from within the vmm_domain.
