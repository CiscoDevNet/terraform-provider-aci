documentation:
    autoContinue: The route_map_continue applies a continue statement for all user-configured sequences (contexts) in a given BGP route profile so that switches will continue to find matches with subsequent user-configured sequences in the route map. Without the continue statement, after a route matches one of the sequences in a route map, switches will not continue to check other sequences.
    type: The type of the %s object. Use combinable when pervasive subnets (fvSubnet) and external subnets (l3extSubnet) should be combined with a route profile and merged into a single route map or route map entry. Use global when the route profile is the only source of information to generate a route map, this will overwrite other policy attributes.
